# Cursor Rules - Wasplanning Systeem

## Tech Stack (NEVER CHANGE)
- Backend: NestJS + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + TypeORM + Redis + MinIO
- Frontend: Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + shadcn-vue + Pinia + TailwindCSS
- Mobile: Expo + React Native + Zustand + NativeWind
- Real-time: Socket.io
- Auth: JWT + Role-based access

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript everywhere
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use async/await over Promises
- Follow existing naming conventions
- NO console.log in production code
- Use proper error handling with try/catch
- Always validate DTOs with class-validator

## Backend Rules
- All endpoints MUST have Swagger decorators
- Use modules for feature organization
- Database entities in separate files
- Always use transactions for multi-table operations
- Redis for caching and job queues only
- MinIO for all file storage (photos, documents)

## Frontend Rules
- Use composables for shared logic
- Pinia stores for global state
- shadcn-vue components ONLY (no other UI libs)
- TailwindCSS for styling (no custom CSS unless absolutely needed)
- TypeScript for all .vue files
- Use $fetch for API calls

## Mobile Rules
- Expo SDK features preferred over native modules
- NativeWind for styling (TailwindCSS syntax)
- Zustand for state management
- TypeScript for all components
- File-based routing with Expo Router

## Multi-Tenancy (MANDATORY)
- ALL entities MUST have tenant_id foreign key
- ALL API endpoints MUST be tenant-aware
- Row-Level Security MUST be enabled on tenant-scoped tables
- JWT tokens MUST include tenant context
- Redis keys MUST be namespaced by tenant
- MinIO buckets MUST be per tenant
- WebSocket rooms MUST be tenant-specific

## User Roles (FIXED - Per Tenant)
1. Werkplaats - submit wash requests only
2. Wassers - view queue, update status
3. Haal/Breng Planners - view completion status only
4. Wasplanners - manage queue and assignments
5. Garage Admin - manage users and settings for their garage
6. Super Admin - manage all garages and global settings

## Database Naming
- snake_case for table/column names
- UUID primary keys
- created_at/updated_at timestamps
- Soft deletes with deleted_at

## API Conventions
- RESTful endpoints
- /api/v1/ prefix
- Consistent response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- JWT in Authorization header

## File Structure (NEVER CHANGE)
